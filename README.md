# Description
A simple python script for extracting generation-dependent information from [Serebii's National Dex](https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/nationalpokedex.shtml). The goal is to generate a JSON file complete with all the available data on each pokemon, as well as sprites (including animated ones from bulbapedia).
## TODO List
- support for pokedex pages generations 4 through 9
- clean up the functions for generations 1 and 2
- output data to json format
- grab data for what the pokemon evolves into and at what level
- download sprites from bulbapedia
- download move info for each generation
- download item info for each generation
- improve error handling
